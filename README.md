# WindowDrone

## What is it

The window drone is a drone that can be assembled and programmed soley by the user.


Its flight controller is a NUCLEO-L476RG board programed on the STM32 Cube IDE


The rest of the parts i.e. ECS's, motors and radio reciver were bought to connect to the NUCLEO Board


This Project is far from finished so code is incomplete

## Important

The ESC_Control Library is where the up to date working flight controller is. When finished I will combine all the files into one.
